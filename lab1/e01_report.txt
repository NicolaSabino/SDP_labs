_EO1 Report_

The program is composed by
- `filler()` method that fills the array with random numbers.
- `print()` method that prints arrays.
- `selectionSort()` in order to sort the arrays.
- `txtFilePrinter()` and `binFilePrinter()` methods that stores sorted arrays
  in files.

_Additional Notes_
Since we need different random number at each iteration of our program a seed
is set at the beginning of the program using the function `srand()`.
