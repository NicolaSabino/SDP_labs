_EO2 Report_

The program is composed by
- `filler()` method that fills the array with random numbers.
- `print()` method that prints arrays.
- `selectionSort()` in order to sort the arrays.
- `txtFilePrinter()` and `binFilePrinter()` methods that stores sorted arrays
  in files.
- `child1Routine()` and `child2Routine()` in order to distinguish process in
  the source file.

  Respect to E01, each vector is processed in a different process properly created
in the `main()` function with the command `fork()`
[lines 37-40]

  The father process waits the children using the `while` structure, the
`child_process` counter and the `wait()` command;

_Additional Notes_
Since we need different random number at each iteration of our program a seed
is set at the beginning of the program using the function `srand()`.
