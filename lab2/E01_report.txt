_E01 Report_

The program is composed by
- `fill_vector()` in order to fill arrays
- `generate_file()` it create binary files starting from an array
- `client_body()` for the client thread
- two semaphores `sem1` `sem2` and a `mutex` to manage the critical section of
	the two threads.
- a global variable `g` contention between the two threads

	The mutex ensures that only one thread per time can acces to each critical
section and manipulate the global variable `g`.

	The two semaphore ensure the alternance of thread1 and thread1

	Each thread can acces to an `Infos` data structure containing the filename and
the number of items of the file.

_Additional Notes_
The main structure of the program is based on E01 of L01
