_E01 Report_

The program is composed by
- struct called `circular_buf_t` in order to implement a circular buffer
- some methods to handle `circular_buf_t` buffers
- A provided method  `current_timestamp`
- A `producer_body()` method
- A `consumer_body()` method
-	`choose_buffer()` to implement the choose between the two buffers with a given
	percentage
- An additional method called `ms2ts()` to handle timespec variables

	Each buffer, the Normal and the Urgent one, is provided of two semaphores to
coordinate empty and the full sate. In addition the mitex manage the access into
the critical section of the buffer.

	The producer call `choose_buffer()` in order to select a target buffer in a
certain percentage - 80% urgent 20% normal.

	The `sem_trywait()` function is used at row 171 to implement a preference
between the normal and the urgent buffer. The producer tries always to serve the
urgent buffer before the normal one
