_E02 Report_

The program is composed by
- struct called `circular_buf_t` in order to implement a circular buffer
- some methods to handle `circular_buf_t` buffers
- A `producer_body()` method
- A `consumer_body()` method
- An additional method called `ms2ts()` to handle timespec variables

	The program is composed of two threads, a producer and a consumer, accessing
to a single buffer resource, implemented with custom semaphores.

	The buffer is provided of two semaphores to coordinate empty and the full sate.
In addition the mitex manage the access into the critical section of the buffer.

	The semaphores are realized via mutexes and conditions in `sema_init()`,
`sema_destroy()`, `sema_wait()`and `sema_post()`.
