_E03 Report_

The program is composed by
- A `mapping_procedure()`
- two implementation of quick sort algorithm
- A `swap()` procedure
- A `partition()` procedure
- A `thread_body()``

	At the beginning the mapping procedure is performed in order to store in a appropriate
vector the whole file using the method mapping_procedure(char* file_name).

	The multi-thread implementation of the `QuickSort` method is obtained with two
`pthread_create()`` since the threshold size is reached. Otherwise the normal recursive
method is called. Furthermore, the structure infos t helps the multi-thread implementation to keeps
track of sub-partitions of the vector in each thread.

	The normal recursive QuickSort algorithm is provided via two methods.
- `partition(int low, int high)` which is able to split correctly into two section the
vector.
- `quickSort(int low, int high)` which call the method partition and do the recursive
call to itself.
